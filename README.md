## AmbientNoise

Codes for ambient noise tomography of Alaska

This is a developing repo for codes associated with the Alaska ambient noise/event-based surface wave/receiver function imanging project. 
The eventual aim is to turn this into something similar to EarthImaging, which is a downloadable imaging package.  

The codes here can fetch data, carry out the ambient noise processing workflow of Bensen (2007) and run ITOMO to generate 
phase velocity maps at selected periods. They can also be used to plot the results and aid in the production of 3D models of VsV with depth (The Computer Programs in Seismology suite is needed for this part).  

See the Wiki page for a more complete readme. Note that this is not intended to be a full software package, more just a collection and explanation of codes that were used for the Alaska ambient noise/surface wave/receiver function project. The workflows involved are quite convoluted and use a variety of scripts and software. This is not ideal and it may be worth the time to streamline to workflow if this is going to be used by multiple people in future.
