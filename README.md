## AmbientNoise

Codes for ambient noise tomography of Alaska

This is a developing repo for codes associated with the Alaska ambient noise/event-based surface wave/receiver function imanging project. 
The eventual aim is to turn this into something similar to EarthImaging, which is a downloadable imaging package.  

The codes here can fetch data, carry out the ambient noise processing workflow of Bensen (2007) and run ITOMO to generate 
phase velocity maps at selected periods. 

A more detailed readme should follow.
