#Run the codes in this order:
#Be sure to check paths to the executables in each script

Get_Prep_Data.sh - edit with your region coordinates and station/network combination
Make_Station_List.sh - generates a file called station.list
Run_Pack_Correlate.sh - generates a directory called COR, containing the correlations

Copy the file Stack_Month_Correlations.sh into COR and run. Be sure to also make parameter file in the correct format (see script)

Edit the paths in Cut_to_SYM_comp.sh and run - in the STACKs directory (assuming this is what you named it), this will generate two new directories, SYM and TWO_COMPS

Time to run FTAN: Copy the script Run_FTAN.sh into STACKS directory. Be sure to put an example dispersion curve in the SYN directory 

- Make the example dispersion curve by running Generate_dispersion.sh in a directory containing the file 0.0_0.0_calculated_dispersion. Edit this script with 
the input model you want (must be preset) and the coordinates at which to calculate the dispersion curve


Run Select_Dispersion_SNR_DIST.sh - edit this script to point to the output direcory where you want the dispersion curves to end up
This will extract phase and group velocities and generate the curves 

Time to run the tomography step (itomo needs to be installed)
cd to the newly created dispersion curves directory and run 
Run_TomoLoop.sh

This calls Run_Tomo.sh on all of the dispersion curves. It also creates a checkerboard test
Ouputs .grd files, whih can be visualized using map_phase_vel.sh and Generate_maps.py
